<h1>Assignment 1</h1>
<p>This is a pretty bare bones summary of the assignment, basically it's just showing competence with the platform.<br><br>
First, I demonstrate that I can load a cart from the Lexaloffle BBS.</p>
<img src="images/Assignment_01_01.gif" alt="This is an animated image of the Pico-8 console wherein the Pico-8 cart Farm Panic is loaded from the Lexaloffle BBS. The cart is then Run and an image of a Bear in a sun hat on a farm scene appears."/>
<p>Then, I demonstrate that I managed to find a Pico-8 cart that doesn't have sprites. And consequently, I copy pasted the code into a new cart and ran it.</p>
<img src="images/Assignment_01_02.gif" alt="This is an animated image of the Pico-8 console wherein the code for the cart And Alls is Well is copy pasted into the code segment of a new cart. The cart is Run and an image of a circular rainbow appears and animates."/>
<p>This is just a demonstration of the classic Hello World assignment using Pico-8's limited Lua language.</p>
<img src="images/Assignment_01_03.gif" alt="This is an animated image of the Pico-8 console wherein a print command saying Hello Misha is entered. The cart is run and the text Hello Misha is displayed."/>
<p>This bit is just exploring the Splore menu.</p>
<img src="images/Assignment_01_04.gif" alt="This is an animated image of the Pico-8 console wherein the Splore command is entered and the Splore menus for New, Lucky Draw, Favourites, Jam, Search and Work in Progress are browsed."/>
<p>And this is an image of my file system... I am uncomfortable with this being online for some reason.</p>
